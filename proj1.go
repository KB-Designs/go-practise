Calculate Balance

We need to calculate the total cost for a batch of messages, and update the userâ€™s balance if they have enough money.
Assignment

Using the given variables, write conditional statements to calculate and update the variables.

    Set finalCost to the bulkMessageCost.
    If the user is a premium user, apply the discountRate to the finalCost.
        For example, a discountRate of 0.10 means the discounted price per message would be 90% of the original price.
    If the user has enough money in their accountBalance:
        Deduct finalCost from their accountBalance.
        Print the purchaseSuccessMessage
    If not, just print the insufficientFundMessage.
